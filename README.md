# Product Splash Page Exercise - Scrimba Module 6: Responsive Design 

## About The Exercise

This recommended exercise was undertaken to consolidate and demonstrate responsive design skills learnt during the second part of the Scrimba Responsive Design module. The page is an adaptation of the Scrimbafy.me example used to learn the following skills and concepts:

- Responsive challenges;
- Text-transform;
- Letter-spacing;
- Viewport units vh and vw;
- Style responsive form elements; 
- Flexbox order;
- Modifier classes;
- Box-sizing;

I also experimented with adding a scrim overlay to a background image to accentuate text.
